# EyE4
An eye-gaze-based communication tool for assistance and emergencies

## Overview
EyE4 is a real-time communication system designed for individuals with limited mobility or speech. It allows users to select words and phrases using only their eye movements and a standard webcam. Emergency keywords like "Suffocation" or "Pain" immediately trigger alarms with flashing visuals and audio.

## Features
- Word and phrase selection using eye-gaze detection via webcam
- Emergency keyword recognition with full-screen alerts and audio signals
- Custom text entry using on-screen alphabet navigation
- Spoken feedback via text-to-speech
- Automatic logging of emergency events and typed messages
- Comes with a standalone executable (`EYE4.exe`) â€” no installation needed

## How to Use

### Option 1: Run the Executable
1. Download and open `EYE4.exe`
2. Grant webcam access when prompted
3. Follow on-screen calibration instructions
4. To type:
   - Look left or right to browse options
   - Hold gaze for 3 seconds to confirm a selection
5. Selections will be spoken aloud automatically

**Note:** Emergency phrases like "Suffocation" or "Hospital" will trigger flashing alerts and will not stop until you press the `Esc` key.

### Option 2: Run from Python Source
1. Clone this repository or download `EYE4.py`
2. Install dependencies:

```

```
